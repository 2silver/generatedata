The weight field lets you change the probability of each item appearing so you can create more realistic-looking data. For example, say you wanted to generate a list of professions, but wanted 'Brain surgeon' and 'Astronaut' to appear very infrequently because they're not common. For that, you could just bump up the weights of the others:",
